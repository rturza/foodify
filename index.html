            <p class="textiy">Foodify's Corporation is an American fast food company, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand, and later turned the company into a franchise, with the Golden logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers. Foodify's had its previous headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to Chicago in June 2018.</p>

                <p>Don't let the recipe name throw you off. Savory baked beans are given a sweet twist in this unique dish. "This is a favorite at potlucks and barbeques," says recipe creator OHHCANDY. "I've often wondered if I get invited for my company or my Cola Beans!"</p>

                <h3>Recipie Three</h3>               
                <p>No cooking required for this refreshing side salad. Reviewer lutzflcat says, "The shoepeg corn is crisp, and the dressing has a nice tang to it. This was a welcome change from my typical mac or potato salad that I often serve with grilled chicken."</p>
